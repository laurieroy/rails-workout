# Workout

This is a social app where a user can track their own workouts, as well as follow what their freids are doing.

This app was developed using BDD (Rspec, capybara) principles on Rails 6.1. The base project is following an older tutorial, that I'm updating as I go along. It uses Rails 5.0 and SQLite, I'm using Rails 6.1 and PG13.
